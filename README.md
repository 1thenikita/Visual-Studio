# DEPRECATED: I no longer wish to use Microsoft products, someone else may fork this repository and maintain the extension as their own.
This extension enables [Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) for Visual Studio 2017 and 2019.

As you're developing, this extension will automatically update your status on Discord to tell the world what you're coding.

You can install the latest release [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualDevelopment.drpcvs2019)

Here's a demonstration of how it looks in Discord
